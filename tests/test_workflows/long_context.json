Started in 1954, and completed in 1988, it is navigable over much of its 1375 km length, and carries 13 km3 of water annually from the Amu-Darya River across the Karakum Desert in Turkmenistan.  The canal opened up huge new tracts of land to agriculture, especially to cotton monoculture heavily promoted by the Soviet Union, and supplying Ashgabat with a major source of water.  Unfortunately, the primitive construction of the canal allows almost 50\u00a0percent of the water to escape en route, creating lakes and ponds along the canal, and a rise in groundwater leading to widespread soil salinization problems.  The canal is also a major factor leading to the Aral Sea environmental disaster. There are three outfall canals in New Orleans, Louisiana \u2013 the 17th Street, Orleans Avenue and London Avenue canals.  These canals are a critical element of New Orleans\u2019 flood control system, serving as drainage conduits for much of the city.

The rail link is fully underground, lies along the south-west coastline of Kowloon Peninsula, east of rail tracks of the Tung Chung\u00a0Line and Airport Express.  Kowloon Southern Link has one underground intermediate station called Austin Station (formerly West Kowloon Station).  It is located adjacent to the Canton Road Government Offices, close to Kowloon Station of Tung Chung Line and Airport Express.  However, the structures do not provide a direct transfer between the two stations. Harbour City is a large shopping mall in Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong.  It is part of a series of office blocks and hotels.  It comprises several parts: Marco Polo Hong Kong Hotel, Ocean Terminal, Ocean Centre (with 1980s retro decor), the Gateway and the Pacific Club Kowloon.  The complex is located along the west side of Canton Road, stretching from the Star Ferry Pier in the south to China Hong Kong City in the north.\nQuestion: Canton Road Station was a planned railway station on the Kowloon Southern Link of West Rail Line, that was to run beneath a large shopping mall located where?\nAnswer: Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong\n\n---\n\nContext: Late Night Final is the second studio album (and first full-length album after the mini-album \"Richard Hawley\" released six months earlier) from musician Richard Hawley, released in the UK in October 2001 by Setanta Records.  Named after the cry of vendors selling the \"Sheffield Star\" evening newspaper on the streets of his home city, it was released to positive reviews.  A single, \"Baby, You're My Light\" was released from the album in February 2002, reaching #81 in the UK singles chart. Lady's Bridge is the fifth studio album from musician Richard Hawley, released on 20 August 2007 in the UK and on 9 October 2007 in the US.  The album follows his 2005 Mercury Music Prize-nominated album \"Coles Corner\".  It is named after the landmark location of Lady's Bridge in Hawley's hometown of Sheffield, an old bridge over the River Don that historically connected the rich and poor parts of the town.  Hawley told \"Uncut\" magazine that \"the title is a metaphor too; it's about leaving the past behind\".  The cover features a photograph, taken by Martin Parr, of Hawley and his guitar at the Club 60 music venue in Sheffield as a tribute to his father Dave who had died of lung cancer earlier that year: Dave Hawley had been a blues guitarist at the club in his youth, playing alongside Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker. Standing at the Sky's Edge is the seventh studio album from English musician Richard Hawley, released in the UK on 7 May 2012 and in the US on 28 August 2012.  The album is markedly different from Hawley's previous efforts, often relinquishing softer instrumentation in favour of squalling guitars.  As with all of Hawley's previous albums, the title obliquely refers to a location in his native city of Sheffield, in this case Skye Edge, a hillside area with views over the city centre and formerly known for its crime-ridden estates but largely redeveloped in the mid-2000s. Richard Willis Hawley (born 17 January 1967) is an English guitarist, singer-songwriter and producer.  After his first band Treebound Story (formed while he was still at school) broke up, Hawley found success as a member of Britpop band Longpigs in the 1990s.  After that group broke up in 2000, he later joined the band Pulp, led by his friend Jarvis Cocker, for a short time.  As a solo musician, Hawley has released seven studio albums.  He has been nominated for a Mercury prize twice and once for a Brit Award.  He has collaborated with Lisa Marie Presley, Arctic Monkeys, Manic Street Preachers and Paul Weller. Catherine was an alternative rock band from Chicago, Illinois that was active from 1985 to 1998.  They were signed to TVT Records. Truelove's Gutter is the sixth studio album from musician Richard Hawley, released on 21 September 2009 in the UK and on 22 September 2009 in the US.  The album title refers to an ancient street in Hawley's native Sheffield, now thought to be the location of present-day Castle Street, which was allegedly named after 18th-century innkeeper Thomas Truelove, who used charge local people to dump their rubbish in the gutter in the street that then flowed down to the River Don.  Thematically, \"Truelove's Gutter\" is Richard's darkest album to date.  Richard told the BBC that the album was inspired by particularly dark periods in his life and those of others.  The album features some uncommon instrumentation, such as the waterphone, megabass, and cristal baschet. Lowedges is the third studio album from musician Richard Hawley.  It was released in the UK in February 2003 by Setanta Records.  It is named after a district in Hawley's home city of Sheffield. A Heavy Nite With... is the debut album by British band Relaxed Muscle fronted by Pulp's Jarvis Cocker, using the pseudonym Darren Spooner.  The other member is Jason Buckle.  It has been alleged that Jason Buckle is a pseudonym for Pulp guitarist Richard Hawley, but this is not the case - Hawley does contribute guitar to the album, however, under the pseudonym Wayne Marsden. Broken is the third full-length studio album from electronica production duo Soulsavers, released by V2 Records in the UK on 17 August 2009, and released by Columbia Records in the US in September as a digital download.  As with their 2007 album \"It's Not How Far You Fall, It's the Way You Land\", a collaboration with Mark Lanegan and a host of guest vocalists, \"Broken\" once again features Lanegan as the primary vocalist, as well as contributions from Bonnie \"Prince\" Billy (Will Oldham), Jason Pierce (of Spiritualized and Spacemen 3), Mike Patton (of Faith No More), Richard Hawley, and Gibby Haynes (of Butthole Surfers).  The non-album single \"Sunrise\", a song written by Lanegan and sung by Will Oldham, preceded the album release on 3 August 2009.  The AA-side is a cover of Palace Brothers' \"You Will Miss Me When I Burn\", written by Oldham and sung by Lanegan, that also features on the album. Longpigs were a British alternative rock band who rose to fame on the fringe of Britpop in the 1990s, comprising Crispin Hunt (vocals), Richard Hawley (guitar), Simon Stafford (bass guitar) and former Cabaret Voltaire member Dee Boyle (drums) who was replaced by Andy Cook for their second album.  Hailing from Sheffield, the group had success with singles such as \"She Said\", \"On and On\", and their well-received debut album \"The Sun Is Often Out\" (1996).\nQuestion: Which industry do Richard Hawley and Chicago's Catherine belong to?\nAnswer: rock band\n\n---\n\nContext: The five main latitude regions of the Earth's surface comprise geographical zones, divided by the major circles of latitude.  The differences between them relate to climate.  They are as follows: Carabus glabratus is a species of beetle.  It is a Boreo-arctic Montane species widespread in Central Europe and Northern Europe north to the Arctic Circle. Smerinthus minor (lesser eyed hawkmoth) is a moth of the family Sphingidae.  It was described by Mell in 1937.  It is a montane species found from the Taibai Shan area, western Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi, China eastwards along the Qinling to southern Shanxi and then north to just west of Beijing.  It has also been recorded from the Miaofeng Mountains near Beijing and the Wuling Mountains in Hunan. Ulmus glabra, the wych elm, Scotch elm or Scots elm, has the widest range of the European elm species, from Ireland eastwards to the Urals, and from the Arctic Circle south to the mountains of the Peloponnese in Greece; it is also found in Iran.  A large, deciduous tree, it is essentially a montane species, growing at elevations of up to 1500\u00a0m, preferring sites with moist soils and high humidity.  The tree can form pure forests in Scandinavia and occurs as far north as latitude 67\u00b0N at Beiarn in Norway.  Wych elm has also been successfully introduced to Narsarsuaq, near the southern tip of Greenland (61\u00b0N). Arctic Circle is one of the five major circles of latitude that mark maps of the Earth. Porthecla peruensis is a butterfly in the Lycaenidae family.  It is found in northern Peru, on the east side of the Andes.  It appears to be a montane species, since it has only been found at altitudes above 1,500 meters. Amietia wittei (common name: Molo frog) is a species of frog in the Pyxicephalidae family.  It is found in Kenya, Tanzania, and eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Its type locality is in Molo, Kenya, located near the top of the Mau Escarpment.  It is a common species associated with montane grasslands, perhaps forests, and also found in a town.  It is found in the Kenyan central highlands and northern Tanzania in the East African montane moorlands and the East African montane forests ecoregions. The Antarctic Circle is the most southerly of the five major circles of latitude that mark maps of the Earth.  The region south of this circle is known as the Antarctic, and the zone immediately to the north is called the Southern Temperate Zone.  South of the Antarctic Circle, the sun is above the horizon for 24 continuous hours at least once per year (and therefore visible at midnight) and (at least partially) below the horizon for 24 continuous hours at least once per year (and therefore not fully visible at noon); this is also true within the equivalent polar circle in the Northern Hemisphere, the Arctic Circle. The Arctic Circle is the most northerly of the abstract five major circles of latitude as shown on maps of the Earth.  It marks the northernmost point at which the noon sun is just visible on the northern winter solstice and the southernmost point at which the midnight sun is just visible on the northern summer solstice.  The region north of this circle is known as the Arctic, and the zone just to the south is called the Northern Temperate Zone.  North of the Arctic Circle, the sun is above the horizon for twenty-four continuous hours at least once per year (and therefore visible at midnight) and below the horizon for twenty-four continuous hours at least once per year (and therefore not visible at noon); this is also true within the equivalent polar circle in the Southern Hemisphere, the Antarctic Circle. Nepenthes attenboroughii ( or ), or Attenborough's pitcher plant, is a montane species of carnivorous pitcher plant of the genus \"Nepenthes\".  It is named after the celebrated broadcaster and naturalist Sir David Attenborough, who is a keen enthusiast of the genus.  The species is characterised by its large and distinctive bell-shaped lower and upper pitchers and narrow, upright lid.  The type specimen of \"N.\u00a0attenboroughii\" was collected on the summit of Mount Victoria, an ultramafic mountain in central Palawan, the Philippines.\nQuestion: What type of species is a Boreo-arctic Montane species found in the most northerly of the abstract five major circles of latitude as shown on maps of the Earth?\nAnswer: beetle\n\n---\n\nContext: Maurice G\u00e9n\u00e9reux is a Canadian physician who was convicted in 1998 of prescribing medications to two HIV positive men in Toronto, Canada in 1996; medications that subsequently allowed the men, Mark Jewitt and Aaron Mcginn, to commit suicide in 1996.  G\u00e9n\u00e9reux was the first doctor in North America to be convicted of assisting a suicide (followed in 1999 by Jack Kevorkian). Vacco v. Quill, 521 U.S. 793 (1997), is a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the United States regarding the right to die.  It ruled 9-0 that a New York ban on physician-assisted suicide was constitutional, and preventing doctors from assisting their patients, even those terminally ill and/or in great pain, was a legitimate state interest that was well within the authority of the state to regulate.  In brief, this decision established that, as a matter of law, there was no constitutional guarantee of a \"right to die.\" Jacob \"Jack\" Kevorkian ( ; May 26, 1928 \u2013 June 3, 2011) was an American pathologist and euthanasia proponent.  He is best known for publicly championing a terminal patient's right to die via physician-assisted suicide; he claimed to have assisted at least 130 patients to that end.  He was often portrayed in the media with the name of \"Dr. Death\"; however, many consider him a hero, as he helped set the platform for reform.  He famously said, \"Dying is not a crime\". California End of Life Option Act is a law enacted in June 2016 which allows terminally ill adults resident in the state of California to access medical aid in dying by self-administering lethal drugs, provided specific circumstances are met.  The law was signed in by California governor Jerry Brown in October 2015, making California the fifth state to allow physicians to prescribe drugs to end the life of a terminally ill patient, often referred to as physician-assisted suicide. Three citizen-initiated measures were voted upon in the 2012 Massachusetts general election: a Right to Repair initiave, a proposal to allow physician-assisted suicide, and a measure to legalize medical marijuana.  The Right to Repair initiative, which was to require open access to vehicle diagnostic and repair information, passed overwhelmingly, with 86% support.  The measure to allow physician-assisted suicide failed by a narrow margin, with 51% opposed.  The proposal to legalize medical marijuana passed with 63% of voter support. Act 39 of 2013 established the U.S. state of Vermont's Patient Choice and Control at End of Life Act (Vermont Statutes Annotated Sec. 1.  18 V.S.A. chapter 113), which legalizes medical aid in dying (commonly referred to as physician-assisted suicide) with certain restrictions.  Vermont was the first state to enact this Law through legislative action; it permits some terminally ill patients to determine the time of their own death. Euthanasia in the Netherlands is regulated by the \"Termination of Life on Request and Assisted Suicide (Review Procedures) Act\" from 2002.  It states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with criteria of due care.  These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life.  To demonstrate their compliance, the Act requires physicians to report euthanasia to a review committee. Christy Canyon (born June 17, 1966) is a retired pornographic actress and American radio personality.  She is an inductee of the AVN and XRCO Hall of Fame. The 1998 Michigan gubernatorial election was held on November 3, 1998, to elect the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of the state of Michigan.  Incumbent Governor John Engler, a member of the Republican Party, was re-elected over Democratic Party nominee Geoffrey Fieger, a lawyer who had represented the assisted suicide advocate Jack Kevorkian. Assisted suicide is defined as suicide committed with the aid of another person, sometimes a doctor.  It applies outside of the medical context as well, assisting a suicidal individual achieve their own death by providing a weapon or other means.  \u201cAssisted suicide\u201d has been used to describe medical aid in dying in the United States for terminally ill, mentally capable adults who self-administer medication to shorten their own dying process.  The term is often used interchangeably with physician-assisted suicide (PAS), \"physician-assisted dying\", \"physician-assisted death\", \"aid in dying\", \"death with dignity\", \"right to die\", \"compassionate death\", \"compassionate dying\", \"end-of-life choice\", and \"medical assistance at the end of life\".\nQuestion: Which of the following is best known for publicly championing a terminal patient's right to die via physician-assisted suicide: Christy Canyon or Jack Kevorkian?\nAnswer: Jacob \"Jack\" Kevorkian\n\n---\n\nContext: Nobody's Daughter is the fourth and final studio album by American alternative rock band Hole, released worldwide on April 27, 2010, through Mercury Records.  The album was originally conceived by Hole frontwoman Courtney Love as a solo project titled \"How Dirty Girls Get Clean\", following her poorly received solo debut \"America's Sweetheart\" (2004).  Much of the material featured on \"Nobody's Daughter\" originated from studio sessions for \"How Dirty Girls Get Clean\", which had been conceived in 2006 after a multitude of legal issues, drug addiction, and rehabilitation sentences had left Love \"suicidal\".  Love financed the making of the record herself, which cost nearly two million dollars. Courtney Love is an American musician and actress who began her professional career in film in 1986 with a supporting role in Alex Cox's \"Sid and Nancy\" (1986); she had prior studied film with experimental director George Kuchar at the San Francisco Art Institute in 1984, and appeared in one of Kuchar's short films.  After pursuing music and having a successful career as the frontwoman of alternative rock band Hole, Love also had intermittent roles in films, most notably receiving critical attention for her performance as Althea Flynt in Milo\u0161 Forman's 1996 biopic \"The People vs. Larry Flynt\", which earned her a Golden Globe Nomination for Best Actress, as well as awards from the Boston, Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles film critics associations.  Love later appeared among an ensemble cast in \"200 Cigarettes\" (1998), as well as in a leading role in \"Man on the Moon\" (1999) alongside Jim Carrey, for which she received critical recognition.  She later appeared in several independent films and short subjects as well as the thriller \"Trapped\" (2002) alongside Charlize Theron and Kevin Bacon, and \"Julie Johnson\" (2001), for which she received an award for Best Actress at Los Angeles' gay and lesbian Outfest film festival.

It was released by DGC Records on April 12, 1994, just one week after frontwoman Courtney Love's husband, Kurt Cobain, died in their home.  It was Hole's only album to feature bassist Kristen Pfaff before her death in June 1994.  Recorded in October 1993, the album marked a divergence from the band's unpolished hardcore aesthetics to more refined melodies and song structure, and features production by Sean Slade and Paul Q. Kolderie, with mixing by Scott Litt and J Mascis.  The album's lyrics and packaging reflect Love's preoccupation with beauty, and its songs contain repeated motifs of milk, motherhood, anti-elitism, and violence against women.  The album's title is derived from a quote in \"Gone with the Wind\". \"Turpentine\" is a song by the American alternative rock band Hole.  It was written by vocalist and rhythm guitarist Courtney Love and lead guitarist Eric Erlandson.  The song was one of the band's first compositions and remained unreleased for seven years before being released on the band's second EP, \"The First Session\" on August 26, 1997.

The company was established in 1846, when John Holly Knapp and William Wilson purchased half of interest in a lumber mill on the Red Cedar River from David Black; it was originally known as Black & Knapp.  Later Andrew Tainter acquired a quarter-interest, and the company has become Knapp-Tainter Lumber Company.  Henry Stout bought a quarter interest in the company in 1853, and its name became Knapp, Stout & Company.  The company's location allowed it to control the lumber industry in the region, and by 1870 it controlled the logging industry in the Red Cedar River valley.  In 1878, the company incorporated, and its official name became the Knapp, Stout & Co., Company.  The company employed over 2,000 workers in the Menomonie area and produced 85 million board feet of lumber on average yearly from 1871 to 1896; its output made it the largest lumber company in the world.  In the 1880s, the company expanded to sites along the Mississippi River, opening offices in Dubuque, Iowa, Read's Landing, Minnesota, and St. Louis.  By the 1900s, the company had largely depleted its lumber supply; it closed many of its camps and dissolved early in the 20th century.  The company sent out its last shipment of lumber on August 12, 1901. Syncros is a brand of bicycle components, with an emphasis on off-road bicycle parts.  Founded by Peter Hamilton and Pippin Osborne in 1986 and originally based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Syncros had its heyday in the early 1990s as one of the earliest and most sought-after brands of high end aftermarket off-road bicycle parts.  In the late 1990s, the company had financial difficulties and was sold to the large U.S. based bicycle company GT.  Shortly thereafter, GT itself was purchased by Schwinn, which in turn was purchased by Pacific Bicycle Group, a large Taiwanese conglomerate known mainly for low end, mass market bicycles and parts.  Pacific was quick to try to capitalize on the Syncros brand name, and used the Syncros label on many cheaply produced OEM parts, severely damaging the brand's reputation.  Due to a lapse in trademark registration in the early 2000s, the Syncros brand name was briefly grabbed in the UK by Super Cycles of Nottingham.  However, a settlement was reached between Super Cycles and Pacific, resulting in Pacific regaining control of the brand name. Murco Petroleum Ltd is a United Kingdom based oil refining company.

Howard is a 2009 collection of dark fantasy and horror short stories written by Robert E. Howard, selected and with an introduction by John Clute.  Most of the stories were originally published in various fantasy magazines and feature Howard's heroes Kull, Bran Mak Morn and Conan, among others.  It was first published in paperback in September 2009 by Penguin Books in its Penguin Modern Classics series. Robert E. Howard's Conan: Adventures in an Age Undreamed Of, or simply Conan: Adventures in an Age Undreamed Of, is a sword and sorcery British pen-and-paper role-playing game set in the world of Conan the Barbarian, the fictional Hyborian Age.  Both the character and the setting were first imagined by American author Robert E. Howard (1906-1936) as of 1932 and until his suicide in 1936.  Howard's original literary work has since spawned a vast franchise of novels, comic books, films, video games, board games, role-playing games, etc.  Following this tradition, \"Conan: Adventures in an Age Undreamed Of\" is the third officially licensed Conan role-playing game.  The two precedent games were \"Conan Role-Playing Game\" (1985-1988) and \"\" (2004-2010), although there also had been supplements for independent generic systems, like \"GURPS Conan\" (1988-1989). Valeria is a pirate and adventuress (a member of \"The Red Brotherhood\" of pirates) in the fictional universe of Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian stories.  She appears in Robert E. Howard's Conan novella \"Red Nails\", serialized in \"Weird Tales\" 28 1-3 (July, August/September & October 1936).  This was the last Conan story written by Howard, and published posthumously.  The name was also used for Conan's love interest in the 1982 film \"Conan the Barbarian\". Optometry is a health care profession which involves examining the eyes and applicable visual systems for defects or abnormalities as well as the medical diagnosis and management of eye disease.  Traditionally, the field of optometry began with the primary focus of correcting refractive error through the use of spectacles.  Modern day optometry, however, has evolved through time so that the education curriculum additionally includes intensive medical training in the diagnosis and management of ocular disease in countries where the profession is established and regulated.  Optometrists (also known as Doctors of Optometry in the US and Canada for those holding the O.D. degree or Ophthalmic Opticians in the UK) are medical professionals who provide primary eyecare through comprehensive eye examinations to detect and treat various visual abnormalities and eye diseases.  Being a regulated profession, an optometrist's scope of practice may differ depending on the location.  Thus, disorders or diseases detected outside the treatment scope of optometry are referred out to relevant medical professionals for proper care, more commonly to ophthalmologists who are physicians that specialize in tertiary medical and surgical care of the eye.  Optometrists typically work closely together with other eye care professionals such as ophthalmologists and opticians to deliver quality and efficient eyecare to the general public. The Lee Family Digital Archive is a scholarly effort to collect, edit, and disseminate the papers of the Lee family of Virginia.  The Lees of Virginia included Richard Lee I, the immigrant founder of the family, who came to Virginia from England around 1640, and his descendants.  Some of the most famous Lees are Thomas Lee, the President of Virginia; Richard Henry Lee and Francis Lightfoot Lee, signers of the Declaration of Independence; Arthur Lee, the Penman of the Revolution; Light-Horse Harry Lee, the cavalry hero of the Continental army, three-time governor of Virginia, and the father of Robert E. Lee; Thomas Sim Lee, Revolutionary governor of Maryland; Richard Bland Lee, U.S. Senator; Charles Lee, U.S. Supreme Court justice; Richard Bland Lee II, a noted explorer; Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general who is by far the most famous of the family; William Henry Fitzhugh (Rooney) Lee, the son of Robert E. Lee and a U.S. Congressman from Virginia; and Fitzhugh Lee, Governor of Virginia and Civil War cavalry general.  President Zachary Taylor was a Lee descendant, on his mother's side.

His best-known works are the novel \"The Sportswriter\" and its sequels, \"Independence Day\", \"The Lay of the Land\" and \"Let Me Be Frank With You\", and the short story collection \"Rock Springs\", which contains several widely anthologized stories. Robert E. Howard's legacy extended after his death in 1936.  Howard's most famous character, Conan the Barbarian, has a pop-culture imprint that has been compared to such icons as Tarzan of the Apes, Count Dracula, Sherlock Holmes, and James Bond.  Howard's critical reputation suffered at first but over the decades works of Howard scholarship have been published.  The first professionally published example of this was L. Sprague de Camp's \"Dark Valley Destiny\" (1983) which was followed by other works, including Don Herron's \"The Dark Barbarian\" (1984) and Mark Finn's \"\" (2006).  Also in 2006, a charity, Robert E. Howard Foundation, was created to promote further scholarship. Robert Ervin Howard (January 22, 1906 \u2013 June 11, 1936) was an American author who wrote pulp fiction in a diverse range of genres.  He is well known for his character Conan the Barbarian and is regarded as the father of the sword and sorcery subgenre. Red Sonja is a 1985 Dutch-American sword and sorcery action film directed by Richard Fleischer.  The film introduces Brigitte Nielsen as the title character with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sandahl Bergman, Ronald Lacey, Ernie Reyes, Jr., Paul L. Smith and Pat Roach in supporting roles.  The film features the sword-wielding Marvel Comics character Red Sonja, created by Roy Thomas, who first appeared in Marvel's \"Conan the Barbarian\" series (#23) in 1973.  The film's character of Red Sonja was based on Red Sonya of Rogatino, a character created by Robert E. Howard appearing in his short story \"The Shadow of the Vulture\" (1934).  The film acknowledges that it was \"based on the character created by Robert E. Howard\" in the introductory credits. The National Association for Chiropractic Medicine (NACM) was a minority chiropractic association founded in 1984 that described itself as a \"consumer advocacy association of chiropractors\".  It openly rejected some of the more controversial aspects of chiropractic, including a basic concept of chiropractic, vertebral subluxations as the cause of all diseases.  It also sought to \"reform the chiropractic profession away from a philosophical scope of practice and towards an applied science scope of practice.\"  It stated that it was \"dedicated to bringing the scientific based practice of chiropractic into mainstream medicine\" and that its members \"confine their scope of practice to scientific parameters and seek to make legitimate the utilization of professional manipulative procedures in mainstream health care delivery.\"  \"While the NACM is focused on furthering the profession, its primary focus is on the rights and safety of the consumers.\"  The NACM was the object of much controversy and criticism from the rest of the profession.  It quietly dropped out of sight and its demise apparently occurred sometime between May 30, 2008 and March 6, 2010.\nQuestion: Who has more scope of profession, Richard Ford or Robert E.
