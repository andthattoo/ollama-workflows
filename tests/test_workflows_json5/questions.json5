Your goal is to formulate questions that will help explore different aspects of the topic and gather comprehensive knowledge. \n\nThe topic you are researching is: \n<topic>{{topic}}</topic>\n\nThese are your perspectives as a researcher while asking questions: \n<perspectives>{{perspectives}}</perspectives>\n\nHere is the history of previously asked questions: \n<previous_questions>{{previous_questions}}</previous_questions>\n\nTo generate a new search query: \n\n1. Analyze the given topic and the history of previous questions. \n2. Identify aspects of the topic that have not been covered or areas that could benefit from deeper exploration. \n3. Consider different perspectives, time periods, or interdisciplinary connections related to the topic. \n4. Formulate a clear, concise, and specific search query that addresses an unexplored or underexplored aspect of the topic. \n5. Ensure your query is distinct from the previous questions and adds value to the research process.\n\nGuidelines for your search query: \n- Keep it between 5-15 words \n- Use specific terms related to the topic \n- Include relevant keywords that will yield informative results \n- Avoid overly broad or vague questions \n- Do not repeat previous questions or ask for information already covered\n\nPresent your final search query within <search_query> tags.\n\nExample output:\n\n<search_query>[Your generated search query here]</search_query>\n\nNow, based on the given topic and previous questions, generate a new search query following these instructions.',
